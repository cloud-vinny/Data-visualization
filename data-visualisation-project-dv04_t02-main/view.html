      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to the Our Data Visualisation Assignment. This site provides interactive visualisations of speeding offence trends across Australia, supporting road safety research and policy.
      </p>

      <h2>About the Data</h2>
      <h3>Data Sources</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>BITRE Enforcement Dataset:</strong> The primary data comes from the Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics (BITRE), which compiles speeding offence records from state and territory police and road safety agencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Population Dataset:</strong> To calculate fines per 10,000 people, we used a second dataset containing population estimates by state and age group. This allows for fair comparisons across regions with different population sizes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What Each Column Means</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Year:</strong> The year the offence was recorded.</li>
        <li><strong>Jurisdiction:</strong> The state or territory where the offence occurred (e.g., VIC, NSW, QLD).</li>
        <li><strong>Metric:</strong> The type of offence or enforcement action (e.g., speeding, camera-detected).</li>
        <li><strong>Start Date:</strong> The month and year of the offence.</li>
        <li><strong>Fines (Count):</strong> The number of fines issued.</li>
        <li><strong>Detection Method:</strong> How the offence was detected (e.g., fixed camera, mobile camera, police issued, red light camera, average speed camera).</li>
        <li><strong>Age Group:</strong> The age bracket of the driver fined (e.g., 0â€“16, 17â€“25, 26â€“39, 40â€“64, 65+).</li>
        <li><strong>Population:</strong> The estimated number of people in the relevant group (from the second dataset).</li>
        <li><strong>Fines per 10,000:</strong> The rate of fines per 10,000 people, calculated using both datasets.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Dashboard Purpose</h2>
      <p>Our goal is to make complex enforcement data accessible and meaningful. By combining offence records with population data, we enable:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fair comparisons between states and age groups, regardless of size.</li>
        <li>Insights into which groups or regions are most affected by speeding offences.</li>
        <li>Evidence-based decisions for road safety policy and resource allocation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Use the Dashboard</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>View Data (this page):</strong> Learn about the dataset, its sources, and key attributes.</li>
        <li><strong>Chart:</strong> Explore interactive visualisations showing fines by state, age group, detection method, and over time. Use the charts to compare both raw counts and population-adjusted rates.</li>
        <li><strong>Storytelling:</strong> Read a narrative summary of the most important findings and their implications for road safety.</li>
      </ul>
