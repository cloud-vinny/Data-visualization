    <h2>Speeding Fines Across Australia: What the Data Tells Us</h2>
    <p>
      This narrative summarises key insights from Australiaâ€™s speeding offence data. It highlights how enforcement varies across states, age groups, detection methods, and time periods.
    </p>

    <h3>Fines by State</h3>
    <p>
      The map shows wide variation across states. NSW and VIC issue the most fines overall, but ACT and NT have higher fines per 10,000 residents â€” suggesting greater enforcement intensity or local policy differences.
    </p>

    <h3>Fines by Age Group</h3>
    <p>
      Drivers aged 17â€“25 receive the highest number of fines per capita, indicating either more frequent violations or targeted enforcement. Older age groups, especially 65+, receive fewer fines.
    </p>

    <h3>Detection Method</h3>
    <p>
      Most fines are issued through fixed and mobile cameras. Some states rely more on police-issued or red light camera fines. This difference can influence how and where drivers are monitored.
    </p>

    <h3>Trends Over Time</h3>
    <p>
      The time series reveals fluctuations in fine volumes. These changes often correlate with policy updates, technology rollouts, or awareness campaigns, offering insights into enforcement impact.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      By combining enforcement records with population data, this dashboard provides a clearer understanding of road safety dynamics across Australia. These insights can guide better-informed decisions in public safety and transport policy.
